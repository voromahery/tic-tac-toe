## [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)

Tic Tac Toe is a board game that can be played with 2 people competing against to each other. Each person has a piece whether cross (X) or circle (O). The goal is to get three of your pieces aligned (eg: XXX or OOO), horizontally or vertically or diagonally.

By building this application, I learned to use Redux toolkit and it helped me a lot to be confident with React and TypeScript.
